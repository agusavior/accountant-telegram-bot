## Getting started

To manually create a virtualenv on MacOS and Linux:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
```

After the init process completes and the virtualenv is created, you can use the following
step to activate your virtualenv.

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Once the virtualenv is activated, you can install the required dependencies.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Rename the file `env.example.py` to `env.py` and change its internal values.

Run it.
```bash
python __init__.py
```
